\description{
Though R is not strictly OO it is sometimes useful to add some object orientation.
In the case of a shiny app with an dynamically created user interface a bit
of pseudo polymorphism helps to avoid too many but,ifs and elses.
Depending on the query type that is selected by the user a UI creation
method is called.
