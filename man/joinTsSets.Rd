\item{active}{Should the new set be marked as active}

\description{
This will create a new set set_name_new with the keys from both 
set_name_1 and set_name_2 combined.
By default the description will be a combination of the descriptions
of the subsets and the new set will only be active it BOTH subsets
were active.
